# Migration Plan: ChatGPT Projects to Gemini Gems

This plan outlines a 5-step process to migrate long-running, grouped conversations (like "Projects" in ChatGPT) to the Google Gemini environment using the custom **Gems** feature and **Google Drive** integration.

## Goal

Recreate the persistent context, file access, and organizational grouping of a ChatGPT Project within a dedicated Gemini Gem.

## 5-Step Migration Workflow

### Step 1: Project Inventory & Data Export (ChatGPT Side)

| Task | Detail | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1. Extract Project Instructions** | Copy the full text of the Project's Custom Instructions. | ChatGPT Project Settings |
| **1.2. Export Files** | Download all files (PDFs, code, data) that were uploaded to the project. | ChatGPT Project Files |
| **1.3. Summarize Context** | Prompt ChatGPT to generate a **brief, one-paragraph summary** of the project's history, key decisions, and where the work currently stands. | ChatGPT Conversation |

### Step 2: Organize Project Assets (Google Drive)

Google Drive will serve as the project's organized knowledge base, which Gemini can access via the `@GoogleDrive` extension.

| Task | Detail | Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1. Create Dedicated Folders** | Create a specific, uniquely named folder for **each** project (e.g., `GMI-ClientX-Proposal`). | Google Drive |
| **2.2. Upload Project Files** | Upload all files collected in Step 1.2 into their respective project folders. | Google Drive |

### Step 3: Create Your Project Gem (Gemini Side)

A Gem acts as a dedicated, persistent AI assistant for your project.

| Task | Detail | Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1. Create a New Gem** | Navigate to the Gems section and begin creating a new custom assistant. | Gemini (Web Interface) |
| **3.2. Name the Gem** | Give it a clear, project-specific name (e.g., **"Q3 Marketing Strategy Assistant"**). This will be your project grouping mechanism. | Gemini Gem Builder |
| **3.3. Paste Instructions** | Paste the Project Instructions copied in Step 1.1 into the Gem's customization field. This sets the role, tone, and rules permanently. | Gemini Gem Builder |

### Step 4: Initialize the Project Conversation & Connect Drive

The first prompt connects the historical data (from Step 1.3) with the file storage (from Step 2.1).

1. **Start a Chat:** Select the new **Gem** to begin a conversation.

2. **Use the Context/Reference Prompt:**
   * **Prompt Structure:** Combine the historical summary with the Drive reference.

   * **Example Prompt:**

     > "I am continuing the **[Project Name]** work. The reference files for this project are in my **@GoogleDrive** folder named **[Folder Name from 2.1]**. Here is a summary of our progress: **[Paste the one-paragraph summary from 1.3]**. Now, the next task is to **[State next specific task]**."

### Step 5: Ongoing Project Work

For all future interactions related to that project:

* **To Resume:** Click the existing conversation thread for the Gem in your sidebar, or start a new conversation by clicking the Gem itself.

* **To Reference Files:** Always explicitly use the **`@GoogleDrive`** tool in your prompt to direct Gemini to the files you need for the task.
